Tamagotchis are  kind of like electronic pets that you press buttons to feed it, play with it, and put it to sleep. This is a Tomagotchi web page. You should be able to click a button to check on the pet and see how it's doing. Other buttons can be used to feed it, play with it, and put it to sleep. 
If you don't do any of these often enough, when you check on it, it should be dead.
